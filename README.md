This repo contains both final projects for the Intro to Programming class at NOVA SST 2022/2023.

They are both based on the board game "Game of Life", or "Jogo da Gl√≥ria", as it's known in Portugal.

Both projects had a two-week deadline. The first project was made by me and the second one was made in tandem with @R-Bartmoss.

The language used was Java.
