This repo contains both final projects for the Object-Oriented Programming class at NOVA SST 2022/2023.

The first is a 1984-like surveillance system called "Gossip", and the second is a movie reviewing platform.

Both projects had a two-week deadline and were made in tandem with @R-Bartmoss.

The language used was Java.
